Selecting a tree

No Christmas season can be really _adjective_ unless you have
a/an _adjective_ tree in your _room_. If you live in
a city, you will see many vacant _plural noun_ filled with hundreds of
_plural noun_ for sale. If you live in the country, you can get
your own _noun_ right out of the forest. Go out with a/an
_noun_ and _noun_, and when you see a/an _adjective_
tree you like, you can dig it up and plant it in a/an _noun_
Then you can use it for _number_ years. To make sure you tree
is fresh, shake the branches and see if the _plural noun_ fall off onto
the _noun_. And make sure the tree is very _color_.
Nothing looks worse than a/an _different color_ tree. Just follow these
directions and you can have a perfectly beautiful _something alive_ in
your front room for weeks.
