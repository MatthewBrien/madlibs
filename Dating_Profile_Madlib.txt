I enjoy long, _adjective_ walks on the beach,
getting _verb-ending-in-ed_ in the rain and
serendipitous encounters with _Plural-noun_.
I really like piña-coladas mixed with _liquid_, and romantic, candle-lit _plural noun_.
I am well-read from Dr. Seuss to _Celebrity_.
I travel frequently, especially to _Country_, when I am not busy with work.
(I am a professional _landscape_ _occupation_.)
I am looking for _noun_ and beauty in the form of a _nationality_ goddess.
They should have the _sense_ of a _animal_ and the physique of a _occupation_ .
I would prefer if they knew how to cook, clean, and wash my _noun_.
I know I’m not very attractive in my picture, but it was taken _number_ years ago,
and I have since become more _adjective_.
